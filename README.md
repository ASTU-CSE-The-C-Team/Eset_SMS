Bleeding Edge?
==============
If you want to run the latest version of Gibbon, prerelease, you can get the source from our GitHub repo (https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core).

Remember, though, it is not stable, and you may lose data. This is not for the faint of heart.

Also, if you do this, you will need to manually update your database using CHANGELOG.DB. Yyou can install using gibbon.sql which is from the last stable release, and then update using the most recent changes listed in CHANGEDB.php. Just remember to update the most recent changes every time you update your codebase from GitHub.

Please report any bugs to support@gibbonedu.org.
